### What are 360 photos?

Flat, two-dimensional photos are old news. The future is 360-degree photos that let you look around in any direction from a single standing position. You can share 360-degree photos everywhere from Facebook to Street View, and unlike 360 video, they can be easily snapped using the phone youâ€™ve already got.

### What Are Photo Filters?

The filter can be of a square or oblong shape and mounted in a holder accessory, or, more commonly, a glass or plastic disk in a metal or plastic ring frame, which can be screwed into the front of or clipped onto the camera lens. Filters modify the images recorded.

This is a filter created by me using Vectr, which is an online free graphics software used to create graphics easily and intuitively.
