## Welcome!
The purpose of this website is to present viewers with 360 photos.
### What are 360 photos?

Flat, two-dimensional photos are old news. The future is 360-degree photos that let you look around in any direction from a single standing position. You can share 360-degree photos everywhere from Facebook to Street View, and unlike 360 video, they can be easily snapped using the phone you’ve already got.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Aveyonce/Aveyonce.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
